        Well, hard to tell at the moment. I haven't seen a lot of the UI implemented yet so I'm not sure what needs to be revised right now. 

        I do think think we need arrows to explain how to change factions and colors.

        I also want to make sure we have a splash screen so we need to settle on the name. 

        I really like to see how the menu for the choosing commands for the minions look in application.
        I would like to up the saturation a little bit more overallme
